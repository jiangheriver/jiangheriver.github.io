      Welcome to my homepage at GitHub!<br/>
<br/>
      In the past 10+ years, I worked as a senior software engineer for China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, 
focus on realtime data aquire and moving-window display for earth observation satellites. <br/>
<br/>
      Now I'm interesting in optimize satellites' image process via parrell process by CUDA and OpenMP. I compiled source
codes and ran program on my laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad W530), here are hardware and software configuration for reference.<br/>
<br/>
      Intel i7-3610QM (Ivy Bridge, 4C 8T, 6MB Cache, Base Freq 2300MHz, Max Turbo 3300MHz)<br/>

      12GB DDR3L @1600MHz (Samsung 4GB*2 + SK Hynix 2GB*2)<br/>
      250GB + 240GB + 480GB Crucial/Micron MLC SSD<br/>
      1920x1080 15.6 inch LCD Screen<br/>
<br/>    
      Microsoft Windows 7 x64 Home Premium<br/>
      Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Express for Windows Desktop (with Update5)<br/>
      Nvidia CUDA Toolkit 8.0GA2 (with Patch2)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
      I also installed softwares shown below for Tensorflow, run "pip install --upgrade --ignore-installed tensorflow-gpu"
after all the software had been installed.<br/>
<br/>      
      Python 3.5.4 (last bugfix release of 3.5, need check "Add python.exe to PATH")<br/>
      Python Tools for Visual Studio 2013 (https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/releases/v2.2.2)<br/>
      cuDNN v6.0 (April 27, 2017) for CUDA 8.0<br/>
<br/>
      Some of my source code have also been compiled under CentOS x64 7.2.1511 with GCC version 4.8.5<br/>
